## Design Patterns in Golang
---
Streamline software development for large and intricate systems using design patterns, which provide reusable solutions to prevalent software design challenges. They furnish a structure for constructing adaptable, expandable, and easy-to-maintain software.

This repository showcases popular design patterns from the "Gang of Four" (GoF), authors of "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" (1994). These patterns are applicable to Golang, a versatile programming language known for its efficiency and scalability, widely used in web development, network programming, and system administration.

Explore these instances to enrich your grasp of design patterns and fortify your Golang projects with heightened flexibility and maintainability.


#### CREATIONAL PATTERNS
**Builder Pattern:**
The Builder pattern is a design pattern in Go that helps you build complex objects step by step without exposing their inner details. It separates the construction of an object from its final representation, making it easy to create objects with multiple dependencies. Let's take a simple example to understand this better.

Imagine you are building a car, and a car has many parts like the engine, wheels, seats, and more. Instead of creating a car directly with all these parts, you can use the Builder pattern. Here's how it works:

1. Create a CarBuilder that has methods to set each part of the car, like setEngine, setWheels, and setSeats.

2. Use the CarBuilder to specify the type of engine, the number of wheels, and the type of seats you want for your car.

3. Finally, call a build method on the CarBuilder to construct the car with all the specified parts.

By using the Builder pattern, you can create a car step by step, customize its components, and hide the complexity of building it. This is especially handy when dealing with complex objects with many dependencies, ensuring a clean and easy-to-understand code structure for junior developers.

**Factory Pattern:**
The Factory Method pattern is like a blueprint for creating objects. Instead of specifying exactly which object to make, it lets subclasses make that choice. This is handy when you want to create objects without knowing their exact type.

For example, imagine you're building a game with different character types like wizards and warriors. You can use the Factory Method pattern to create characters without knowing if it's a wizard or warrior until the game starts. This makes your code flexible and easy to extend with new character types in the future.

**Singleton Pattern:**
The Singleton pattern guarantees that a class has just one instance and offers a universal way to reach it. It's handy when you want to make sure there's only a single instance of a class in your program. Imagine a game where you need to keep track of the player's progress throughout the entire game. Using the Singleton pattern, you can ensure there's only one Player object, and you can easily access it from any part of your code whenever you need it.

#### STRUCTURAL PATTERNS
**Adapter Pattern:**
The Adapter pattern helps classes with different interfaces collaborate by introducing a middleman, making them compatible. Imagine you have an old-style plug and a new socket. To make them work together, you use an adapter that fits into the socket and accepts the old-style plug, transforming it into a form the socket can understand. In code, this pattern allows you to connect two incompatible interfaces, like adapting an existing interface to a new one, ensuring they can work together seamlessly.

**Facade Pattern:**
The Facade pattern simplifies complex systems by offering a single, easy-to-use interface to interact with a group of related interfaces within that system. It's like a control panel that hides the complexity behind the scenes. 

For example, think of a computer. You press the power button, and it handles all the intricate processes of booting up, even though there are many components and operations involved, like the CPU, RAM, and hard drive. The power button is the facade that simplifies starting the computer for you.

#### BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS
**Iterator Pattern:**
The Iterator pattern lets you access elements in a collection one by one, without revealing how the collection is structured internally. Imagine you have a list of numbers, and you want to go through them without worrying about whether it's an array or a linked list. The Iterator pattern helps you do just that. It's like a tour guide for your collection, ensuring you can visit every element without needing to know how it's stored.

**Observer Pattern:**
The Observer pattern establishes a relationship where one object (the subject) informs multiple other objects (the observers) when its state changes. Imagine a weather station (subject) that notifies multiple displays (observers) when the temperature changes. This pattern is handy when you want objects to react to changes in another object's state without being tightly coupled.
